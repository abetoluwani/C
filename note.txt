- when you place a zero at the front of any value that value is treated as an octa value
example int var = 052 if we are to printf the value of var when using the %d format specifier
we are going to get 42 because we are converting the octa value to a decimal value 
052 = (0 x 8^2) + (5 x 8^1) + (2 x 8^0)
    = 0 + (5 x 8 ) + (2 x 1)
    = 40 + 2
    =42
else if we use the octa specifier %o we get 52

- scanf %c always skips an input so always use leave a space before it
scanf(" %c",ch)

~ pre increment/decrement = they solve the problem and then return it back
~ post increment/decrement = they assign the given value before incrementing or decrementing


~ After the first true operator in an OR operator statement the other value would never get implemented

~ any number other than zero is treated as true
